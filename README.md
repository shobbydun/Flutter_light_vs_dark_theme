# Flutter Light/Dark Mode Toggle
# Overview
This Flutter project demonstrates how to implement light and dark mode toggling in a Flutter application. 
Users can switch between light and dark modes either manually via a button or automatically based on the system settings.

# Features
Manual Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark modes using a 'TAP' button within the app.
System-based Mode Detection: The app responds to system-wide dark mode settings and adjusts the theme accordingly.

# How to use
To use the app, simply launch it and you'll see a button labeled "Toggle Theme." 
Tap the "TAP" button to switch between light and dark modes manually.
The app will also automatically adapt to your device's system settings, so if you switch your phone's system theme to dark or light mode, the app will reflect this change accordingly. 
Enjoy a seamless experience tailored to your preferred viewing style!
